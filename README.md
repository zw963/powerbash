Have a opportunity you need settings a supported fonts for this.

e.g i use `Konsole + Inconsolata`.

__NOTICE__: this script test with BASH only, i used it more than 6 years without change anythings.
it works quite well for me, but, may not works with others shell.

# How to use it.

Add following code into your's `~/.bashrc`.

```sh
source the/path/of/git-prompt.sh # this file provided by git, some func used in PS1

source the/path/of/powerbash.sh
```
